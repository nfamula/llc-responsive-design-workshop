      #Getting Set Up

      **[Atom](https://atom.io/)** - a text editor with colour highlighting and other useful features. 
      
      If you are unable to install Atom, try installing: <!-- .element: class="note" -->[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) (Mac or Windows) or [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) (older Macs).

      **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. 

      To set Chrome as your default browser, follow<!-- .element: class="note" --> [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). 

      Firefox, Safari, and IE 10+ are great, but their dev tools are slightly different so stick to Chrome for this class please! 
      
      Visit <!-- .element: class="note" -->[browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.

        #Different types of web design

        In order to understand responsive web design and web development better, we have to understand what the options are:

        Fixed/Static, Fluid/Liquid, Adaptive, Responsive

      #Fixed Web Design

      *   Everything has a set width (eg. 960px). 
      *   Popular method before mobile browsing became commonplace.
      *   On a mobile screen, it is zoomed out to the size of the device making the content really small. 
      *   Needs a separate site, usually an "m dot" site, to make something mobile friendly :(

      > Try opening these sites on your phone or resize the browser. What are the differences?

        #Fluid web design
        
        *   Based on percentage widths, each block of content takes up a percentage of the page. (e.g. a sidebar with a width of 30% and main section with a width of ~70%)
        *   When you resize the browser, the blocks will resize *relative* to the size of the page (aka the "viewport").
        *   Not optimized for smaller screens & mobile devices.

      *   Uses _media queries_ to target specific viewport sizes (more on this later).
      *   The content itself changes.
      *   Best to think of it as a _set_ of fixed layouts that are invoked in response to the device size.

      #Mobile-first design

      When responsive design was introduced, it was common to start with a desktop design, then make the design responsive for smaller screens. 
      
      This has changed with smartphones and tablets, giving rise to another approach, *mobile first design*:

      *   design an experience for mobile devices first, then desktop
      *   make mobile integral, not an afterthought
      *   *graceful degradation* and *progressive enhancement*

        #HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
        
        * HTML is the language browsers read, HTML5 is the latest version
        * used to wrap content to assign meaning to the web document
        * use *tags* to create HTML *elements*

        ```xml
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        ```

        Almost all elements have an "opening" tag and a "closing" tag. The closing tag has a forward slash (`/`).

        Example:

        ```xml
        <p>Paragraph with a <a href="#">link</a>.</p>

        ##Headings
        There are 6 heading tags (`<h1>,<h2>,...,<h6>`) and they follow a hierarchical structure.
        
        ```xml
        <h1>Most Important Heading</h1>
        <h2>Second Most Important Heading</h2>
        ```
        
        It's important to use the appropriate heading tag to describe the content, not for the default heading styles. That's what CSS is for!

        #HTML with Attributes
        
        There are some common HTML elements that require the addition of *attributes* to provide more information about the HTML element.
        
        **Links** use an `<a>` tag and an `href` *attribute* to specify where to link to.
        ```
        <a href="http://website.com">link</a>
        ```
        **Images** use an `<img>` tag and the `src` attribute, to link to the image file. An `alt` attribute should also be added for accessiblity. 
        ```
        <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="alternative text">
        ```
        Also note that the image tag has no closing tag.

        Here are two more attributes, mostly used for CSS styling.

        **class** - can be used multiple times per page
        
        ```xml
        <div class="column">Class example</div>
        ```
        
        **id** - can be used for CSS styling, in-page links and only once per page
        
        ```xml

        When HTML tags are nested (written inside of other tags), whitespace is used to increase the readability of the code. 
        
        *Tab* once to show that an element is nested.
        
        ```xml
        <body>

      Nested elements create relationships within the HTML document.  It follows a family tree-like structure with branches of descendants, siblings, parents and children.

      We’re still focusing on the HTML so don’t worry about how it looks just yet. Take this time to personalize your content. Some suggestions are:

      *   Header section: name & tagline
      *   About Me / Profile blurb & image
      *   Work Experience

      **Important!** Avoid changing the existing HTML tags since there will be existing CSS applied to it. But feel free to add/remove non-structural elements like paragraphs, link and images. Ask your mentors if you're not sure!

      #CSS Overview

      CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is used to style the HTML elements.

      A CSS document is made up of many style rules that reference the HTML. These rules include a **selector** and **property: value** pairs.

      ```css
      selector {
        property: value;
      }
      ```

      The **selector** specifies which element(s) to apply the styling to. The **property: value** pairs contain what styles to apply. 

      ```css
      h1 {
        color: red;
      }
      ``` 
      </script>

        #CSS Syntax
        
        ```
        /* This is a CSS comment by the way */
        div {
          border: 3px solid #333;
          background-color: lightblue;
        }
        ```

        * property & values are separated by a _colon_
        * each declaration ends in a _semi-colon_
        * write each declaration on its own line to make it easier to read
        * there are MANY CSS properties, see resource below

      #Class attribute & selector

      Classes are used mostly for CSS styles and can be used one or more times on the same page.  The value of the class is named by you!
      
      To use it, add it in the *opening* HTML tag. You can have more than one class for the same element.

      ```xml
      <div class="wrapper">
        content here
      </div>
      ```

      In the CSS, a class selector starts with a leading period.

      ```
      .wrapper {
        width: 1000px;
      }

        #Class exercise: Change the background image
        
        There are several to choose from in your project, in the **images** folder, all starting with the prefix "background-".
        
        Look for the `body` selector, near the top of the **styles.css** file and change the image file name.
        
        ```
        body {
          ...
          background: url(../images/background-4.jpg) no-repeat fixed;

        #CSS Inheritance

        In **styles.css**, the `body` selector also contains a `font-family` property. 

        ```css
        body {
          font-family: "Merriweather", serif;
        }
        ```
        Why is it declared here?

        In CSS, many styles are inherited from parent elements. 
        
        The nested elements will inherit the styles making it more efficient than repeating styles for individual elements.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Cascading & Specificity
        
        The browser reads CSS rules from top to bottom, so the most recent selector will override the same selector that came before it. Make sure not to use duplicate selectors!
        
        ```css
        h2 {
          margin: 0;
        }
        h2 {
          margin: 20px; /* this style will be applied */
        }
        ```
        However, if the selector is more *specific*, that rule will apply, even if it's not the most recent rule.

        ```css
        section h2 {
          margin: 20px; /* this style will be applied to the h2 in a section element */
        }
        h2 {
          margin: 0;
        }
        ```

        ![](framework/img/workshop/not-fluid-2.png) <!-- .element: width="475" -->

        On the phone, it's even worse! (Screen shot from Chrome's emulator dev tool - more on this later.) It's zoomed out to fit into the devices screen size so everything looks small.

        #Class exercise: Percentages first, then media queries

        In **styles.css**, look for this code block. Notice that the width is set to a fixed width of 1000px.  That means no matter what, that container will always be 1000px.

        ```css
        .content-wrap {
          width: 1000px;
          margin: 0 auto;
          padding: 90px 0;

        Let's change it to `max-width: 1000px;` and also add `width: 80%;` and see how that changes the page.

        #Fluid is not the same as responsive

        It works much better now. The content is scaled relative to the size of the browser.
        
        But it isn't *responsive* yet. 
        
        At a smaller size, you may want to make changes that go beyond just scaling up/down the width of the page components. To make that type of change, we'll need to use responsive techniques and media queries.

        This is an example of a responsive change because the image *changes* size and from left to right. Let's look at how we can target different screen sizes with media queries, to make this kind of change.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        #Media Queries

        Media queries are the key to making a responsive website because it allows you to apply CSS to your document *only* when the screen has reach a certain size. 
        
        Let's take a look at a basic media query.

        ```css
        @media (max-width: 940px) {
          body {
            background: red;
          }
        }
        ```
        In the above we target all [media types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) and the max-width of 940px. Anything *equal to* or *less than* 940px wide will apply this CSS.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Media Queries
        
        You can have multiple CSS declaration blocks in one media query.

        ```css
        @media (max-width: 940px) {
          body {
            background: red;
          }
          h2 {
            font-size: 20px;
          }
        }
        ```
        
        Notice how the CSS is nested inside of the media query's curly brackets `{ }`.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      #Media Queries

      You can also use `min-width` in media queries.
      
      ```css
      @media (max-width: 940px) {
        /* any screen 940px and below */
      }
      @media (min-width: 941px) {
        /* any screen 941px and above */
      }
      ```
      >Why do you think 941px was used for min-width instead of 940px in the above example?
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Media Queries

        You can also specify a range by combining `min-width` and `max-width`.

        ```css
        @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 940px) { 
          ...
        }
        ```
        
        This will only be applied when the width of the browser that is:
        
        *  greater than or equal to 768px
        *  less than or equal to 940px
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Media Queries and Heights

        Viewport heights can be targeting using `min-height` or `max-height`.

        ```css
        @media (min-height: 568px) {
          /* anything as high or higher than the iPhone 5 */
        }
        ```
        
        **Note**: Height-based media queries can be tricky. For example, browser bars may take up different heights and most of the time, you want your content to just flow as long as it needs to be. 
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      #Testing Media Queries

      Adding a noticeable change into each media query can help us to easily see where the breakpoints are. Like this:

      ```css
      @media (max-width: 1000px) {
        body {
          background-color: lightblue;
        }  
      }
      ```

      However, in today's project, there is an image set as the background so in this specific instance, this style won't be as easy to see.  Let's change the font colour instead.

      #Class Exercise: Media Queries!
      
      Where in the stylesheet should you add the media queries? 
      
      Some options are to create a separate style sheet just for media queries or group it with the CSS section it's being applied to. 
      
      Another option is to group all of the media queries together at the bottom of the style sheet. Let's all do that today for consistency.

      ```css
      @media (max-width: 1000px) {
        body {

        #Common breakpoints

        Trying to target a specific device is tricky because there are so many. Here are some to general guidelines to consider:

        320px — Mobile portrait  
        480px — Mobile landscape  
        600px — Small tablet  
        768px — Tablet portrait  
        940px - 1024px — Tablet landscape, small desktop  
        1280px & greater — Desktop  

        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Pro tips!** Use fluid CSS whenever possible, add a breakpoint when the design breaks or no longer suitable for that viewport. Also, be careful about using too many breakpoints. If you have two media queries close in size, try moving the styles to one or the other.

        #Exercise: Media Queries (~15 mins)

        Using the breakpoint guidelines and the first media query example, add two more media queries to target tablet and mobile.  

        Don't forget to test it by making your browser bigger and smaller!

        (See the next slide for the answer but only if you're really stuck!)<!-- .element: class="note" -->

        **Bonus exercise**:
        Change your accent colour! Using Chrome's dev tools, *inspect* any element that has a colour, (e.g. the "Hello" background or a link) to see if you can figure out where the blue CSS color is coming from and change it to your own colour choice.

        #Don't Forget the Viewport Meta Tag!

        The viewport `<meta>` tag **must** be included in the `<head>` of your HTML document to ensure the page responds on mobile devices.

        ```xml
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        ```
        
        * Let's break down the values in the `<meta>` tag:
          * `name="viewport"` - sizing information of the viewport
          * `content` - provides info about how to size the viewport
          * `width=device-width` - tells the browser to be as wide as the device
          * `initial-scale` - the value at which the site is zoomed in/out by default

        >Let's add this to our project now and see how the layout changes in the Chrome emulator.

      # What Can We Improve?

      Here are some things to look out for when optimizing design and page layouts for different screens.

      *   hide elements for different screen sizes <!-- .element: class="delayed" --><br><span class="note">(use this sparingly, if you're hiding a lot of content, maybe you don't need it at all?)</span>
      *   margin, padding and text sizing <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      *   image size and positioning <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        Let's figure out what steps are needed to optimize our about section:

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/profile-right.png">

        1. pick a breakpoint to make this change
        1. move the image to the right side
        1. adjust the width of the image and content area

        We can achieve this by changing the current CSS. To do this, we'll need to use the same or more specific selector.  
        
        > Let's use the Chrome dev tools to inspect our project page and figure out which selector to use and test out some styles rather than just looking at the CSS file.

        #Exercise (~20mins) - Updating the About section

        Using the dev tools, we've determine where and what changes to make. Take this time to try the instructions below to add these updates to your project.  Work with a partner or with a mentor! 

        1. add a media query with a breakpoint around 768px - 900px-ish
        1. For `.profile-image`, these are the values that need to change:
        ```
        float: left;
        width: 27%;
        margin-right: 3%;
        ```
          * adjust these values to make it float to the right
          * increase the profile image width
        1. For `.profile .summary`, these are the values that need to change:
        ```
        float: left;
        width: 70%;
        ```
          * adjust these values to reflect the width changes in the profile image
          * remove the float so the text wraps the image

        ##Hints:
        * make sure your total width percentages equals 100%, including margin!
        * use the value of `none` to reset a float
        * a sample solution is on the next slide

      #What else can we change?

      The **Work Experience** section at a smaller resolution, starts to look squished.  Let's go back to the Chrome dev tools and see what to adjust here.

      Perhaps changing it from two columns, side by side, to stacking the content on top of each other will do the trick.  Let's try it out! 

      Heads up: making responsive changes requires a lot of tweaking and testing and inspecting elements.  Be prepared to do a lot of experimenting!

        #Exercise (~20mins) - Updating Work Experience 

        After looking at the Work Experience section, we've determined where the changes need to be made. The below snippet is the base CSS.  
        
        ```css
        .work-experience .details {
          float: left;
          width: 30%;
          padding-right: 30px;
        }
        .work-experience .description {
          font-size: 14px;
          width: 70%;
          float: right;
          margin-top: 5px;
        }
        ```
        
        * To get rid of the floated two columns try adding these styles:
          * reset the float (hint: use `none`)
          * adjust the width to span all the way across
          * remove/update any padding & margin to your liking

        
        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Pro tip!** Only use the properties that need to be changed.  For example, if the font-size doesn't need to be change, no need to add it to the media query.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/header-tablet.png)
        
        At around a 600px resolution, the header area becomes hard to read and takes up a lot of space for a smaller screen.  
        
        That should be updated to make better use of the space for that resolution.  
        
        Some things that could be updated is the `padding` in the `header` tag and the `font-size` of the `h1` and `h2` in the header.

        1. Change the font-size of the h1 and h2 BUT make sure to target only the headings *nested* in the `header` tag.

        #Hiding Elements
        
        Here's how to do it, but don't make this a habit. 
        
        It's convenient but the browser still needs to load this code, and that slows your site down. 

        ```css
        @media (max-width: somewidthpx) {
          selector {
            display: none;
          }

        #min-width
        
        So far we've been using `max-width` to declare our media queries and then overriding some of the styles as the screen sizes get smaller.  
        
        Another technique would be to use min-width and max-width to specify styles for different screens.
        
        ```
        @media (min-width: 601px) {
          header h1 {
            font-size: 60px;
          }
        }
        @media (max-width: 600px) {
          header h1 {
            font-size: 45px;
          }
        }

      #Tips & Advice for RWD

      Responsive web design is an iterative process. Websites are never "done", even the best can be improved. Try not to get discouraged!

      *   Try to avoid fixed elements & hover effects as necessary parts of the functionality of your site.
      *   Think about **HOW** your user will be using your site: mobile interations are different!
      *   Keep it simple! Less words, utilize white space.
      *   Remember, your site will never look pixel perfect on 100% of viewport sizes.

      You will need to register a domain name and purchase hosting. Here are some suggestions:
      
      * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384) - domains and hosting - use promo code **LLC40** to get $40 off your registration!
      * [hover.com](http://hover.com/ladiescode) - domains - save 10% with the promo code "learningcode"

      Why keep your domains and hosting separate?<!-- .element: class="note" --> [Learn more about Hover](http://ladieslearningcode.com/getting-hosted-domains-with-hover/).

      You will also need to upload your files to your hosting server. You will need some info usually provided by your hosting service provider: FTP Address, Username, Password.
